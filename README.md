# Graph Algorithms Project

This project demonstrates different graph algorithms to find paths and traverse a graph. The following algorithms are implemented:

- Brute Force
- Sequential Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Files

- `graph_data.py`: Contains the graph data.
- `brute_force.py`: Implements the brute force algorithm to find all paths.
- `sequential_search.py`: Implements the sequential search algorithm.
- `dfs.py`: Implements the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
- `bfs.py`: Implements the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
- `test_algorithms.py`: Tests all the implemented algorithms using the graph data.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my_graph_project
2.	Ensure you have Python installed (preferably 3.x).
3.	Run the test script to see all algorithms in action:
   ```
python3 test_algorithms.py
```
